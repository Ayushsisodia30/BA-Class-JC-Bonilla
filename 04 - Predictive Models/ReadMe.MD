##Predictive Models I
This module covers the basics of regression analysis. Our emphasis will be on applications and interpretation of the results for making real life business/policy decisions and not on the mathematical and statistical properties of the techniques used to produce these results. In order to provide a broad intuition of the concepts and methods, we will use data and examples from marketing decision making such as segmentation, estimating market potential and forecasting demand, etc.
##Predictive Models II
We will continue covering regression analysis including non-linear transformations and dummy variables. In addition to advanced regression, we will cover prediction and classification trees.
