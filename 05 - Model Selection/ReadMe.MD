##Model Selection
This week we  discuss the problem of choosing among many models. Although our
examples will be regression problems and some of the discussion and methods
will be specific to linear regression, the problem is general. When many models
are under consideration, how does one choose the best? Thus we also discuss
methods that apply outside the regression context.
